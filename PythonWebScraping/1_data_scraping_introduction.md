## Introduction
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. When you visit a website, you see text, images, links, and other content. A web scraper takes that same information but collects it in a structured way so that it can be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, research, or automation.

```python
print("Welcome Data Scraper!")
```
