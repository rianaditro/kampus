## Sub Topic or Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that helps structure your code into reusable pieces by organizing it around objects, which represent **entities in the real world.** In Python data scraping, using OOP can make your code more **modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.**

Instead of writing separate functions or large procedural blocks, you can organize the scraping process into classes that model real-world entities.

---
## OOP Key Concept
1.Object: An instance of a class. It represents one specific "thing" **created from the class.**
```python
garfield = Cat()
```

2.Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It **defines the properties and methods** of the object.
```python
class Cat:
    # something that related to a real cat
```
---
3.Attributes: Variables that **store data about the object**. They are defined inside the class.
```python
def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

garfield.name = "Garfield"
```
4.Methods: Functions that define the **behavior of an object**. They are defined inside the class and usually use the objectâ€™s attributes.
```python
def speak(self):
    return f"My name is {self.name}"

garfield.speak()
```

## Class Activity
Create a blueprint that represent a dog. Create 10 of dog!

---
## Class Activity
Create a system for library. Who are the entity, how they interact, etc!

---
## Class Activity
Create a program that let the users to send letter each other!

---
## Class Activity
Remember when we talk about Selenium WebBrowser? Create a class that have similiar behaviour with Selenium WebBrowser, it should represent the get, page_source, etc!
