## PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code
PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that provides guidelines and best practices for writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code. It is essentially the official style guide for Python code, helping developers write code that is easy to understand and maintain across different projects and teams.

---
**Key Aspects of PEP8**
1.Indentation: Use **4 spaces** per indentation level.
2.Line Length: Limit all lines to a maximum of **79 characters.**
3.Blank Lines: Use **2 blank lines** before top-level functions and class definitions, and 1 blank line inside functions to separate logic.
4.Imports: **Group imports into three categories**: standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports. Import each module in separate lines.

---
5.Whitespace: **Avoid extra spaces** inside parentheses, brackets, or around operators.
6.Naming Conventions:
    -Variables, functions: Use snake_case.
    -Classes: Use CamelCase.
    -Constants: Use ALL_CAPS.
7. Comments and Docstrings: Use comments to **explain why certain decisions were made**, and use docstrings for functions, methods, and classes to **describe their purpose.**
